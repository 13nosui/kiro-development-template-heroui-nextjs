# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for generating comprehensive project documentation for the existing AI Development Template with HeroUI and Next.js. The goal is to create detailed technical documentation that captures the current system architecture, data flows, TypeScript definitions, API endpoints, and implicit design decisions that are not explicitly documented.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer joining this project, I want comprehensive architecture documentation, so that I can quickly understand the system design and contribute effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the project documentation THEN the system SHALL provide a complete overview of the application architecture including frontend, backend, and external integrations
2. WHEN examining the architecture documentation THEN the system SHALL include component relationships, dependency flows, and technology stack details
3. WHEN analyzing the system design THEN the documentation SHALL capture both explicit and implicit design patterns used throughout the codebase

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working with the API layer, I want detailed API endpoint documentation, so that I can understand all available endpoints and their specifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing API documentation THEN the system SHALL provide a complete list of all REST API endpoints with their HTTP methods, paths, and purposes
2. WHEN reviewing endpoint specifications THEN the system SHALL include request/response schemas, authentication requirements, and error handling patterns
3. WHEN examining API structure THEN the documentation SHALL capture both existing endpoints and inferred API patterns from the codebase

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working with TypeScript, I want comprehensive type definitions documentation, so that I can understand the data models and interfaces used throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing type documentation THEN the system SHALL provide all TypeScript interfaces, types, and enums defined in the project
2. WHEN examining data models THEN the system SHALL include relationships between types, inheritance hierarchies, and usage patterns
3. WHEN analyzing type definitions THEN the documentation SHALL capture both explicit type definitions and inferred types from component props and function signatures

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer understanding data flow, I want visual data flow diagrams, so that I can see how data moves through the application layers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing data flow documentation THEN the system SHALL provide Mermaid diagrams showing data movement between components, services, and external systems
2. WHEN examining data flows THEN the system SHALL include state management patterns, API call flows, and authentication flows
3. WHEN analyzing data movement THEN the documentation SHALL capture both explicit data flows and inferred patterns from component interactions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the project, I want security and configuration documentation, so that I can understand security implementations and environment configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing security documentation THEN the system SHALL document authentication mechanisms, CORS configurations, and security middleware
2. WHEN examining configuration THEN the system SHALL include environment variables, Firebase setup, and deployment configurations
3. WHEN analyzing security patterns THEN the documentation SHALL capture both implemented security measures and configuration requirements

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer extending the project, I want component and hook documentation, so that I can understand reusable components and custom hooks available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing component documentation THEN the system SHALL provide details of all React components including props, state, and usage examples
2. WHEN reviewing custom hooks THEN the system SHALL include hook signatures, dependencies, and usage patterns
3. WHEN examining component architecture THEN the documentation SHALL capture component hierarchies and reusability patterns

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want build and deployment documentation, so that I can understand the development workflow and deployment process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing build documentation THEN the system SHALL include all npm scripts, their purposes, and execution contexts
2. WHEN examining deployment processes THEN the system SHALL document CI/CD configurations, environment setups, and deployment targets
3. WHEN analyzing development workflow THEN the documentation SHALL capture development tools, linting rules, and quality assurance processes
